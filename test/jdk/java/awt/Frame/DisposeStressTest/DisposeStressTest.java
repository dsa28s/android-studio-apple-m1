  @bug 4051487 4145670 8062021
  @summary Tests that disposing of an empty Frame or a Frame with a MenuBar
           while it is being created does not crash the VM.
  @author dpm area=Threads
  @run applet/timeout=7200 DisposeStressTest.html

// Note there is no @ in front of test above.  This is so that the
//  harness will not mistake this file as a test file.  It should
//  only see the html file as a test file. (the harness runs all
//  valid test files, so it would run this test twice if this file
//  were valid as well as the html file.)
// Also, note the area= after Your Name in the author tag.  Here, you
//  should put which functional area the test falls in.  See the
//  AWT-core home page -> test areas and/or -> AWT team  for a list of
//  areas.
// Note also the 'DisposeStressTest.html' in the run tag.  This should
//  be changed to the name of the test.

//Automated tests should run as applet tests if possible because they
// get their environments cleaned up, including AWT threads, any
// test created threads, and any system resources used by the test
// such as file descriptors.  (This is normally not a problem as
// main tests usually run in a separate VM, however on some platforms
// such as the Mac, separate VMs are not possible and non-applet
// tests will cause problems).  Also, you don't have to worry about
// synchronisation stuff in Applet tests they way you do in main
// tests...
