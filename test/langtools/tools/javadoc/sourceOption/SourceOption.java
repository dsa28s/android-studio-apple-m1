/*
 * TEST NOTE
 * With JDK9, this test has been transformed into a NEGATIVE test.
 *
 * Generally speaking, this test should check a feature not in at least
 * one of the currently supported previous versions.  In this manner,
 * a failure of the -source option to be honored would mean a pass of
 * the test, and therefore a failure of the -source option.
 *
 * For JDK9 and JDK10, both support 1.7, which did not support javac's
 * lambda construct.  So we set "-source 1.7" to compile a .java file
 * containing the lambda construct.  javac should fail, thus showing
 * -source to be working.  Thus the test passes.
 *
 * The second jtreg @run command checks to make sure that the source
 * provided is valid for the current release of the JDK.
 *
 *  fixVersion: JDK11
 *      replace ./p/LambdaConstructTest.java with a missing from
 *      JDK8, JDK9, or JDK10.  Set -source below appropriately.
