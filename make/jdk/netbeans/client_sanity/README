This NetBeans project corresponds to client sanity test suite in jdk/test/sanity/client.

It simplifies working on the suite in NetBeans.

It also includes the following custom tasks:

prepare-bundle      creates dist/sanity.zip containing standalone bundle of the suite

run-jemmy-browser   runs Jemmy browser for the ButtonDemo (hardcoded in build.xml file)
                    The tool allows to explore the UI hierarchy.
                    
There is no task to run tests using JTReg. Please refer to corresponding README file 
in the client sanity test suite folder on how to run the tests.
