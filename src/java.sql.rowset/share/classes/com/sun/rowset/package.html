Provides five standard implementations of the standard JDBC <code>RowSet</code> implementation
interface definitions. These reference implementations are included with the J2SE version
1.5 platform and represent the benchmark standard <code>RowSet</code> implementations as verified
by the Test Compatibility Kit (TCK) as mandated by the Java Community Process.
<br>

<h3>1.0 Available JDBC RowSet Reference Implementations </h3>
The following implementations are provided:<br>

<blockquote><code><b>JdbcRowSetImpl</b></code> - The <code>javax.sql.rowset.JdbcRowSet</code>
interface reference implementation. <br>
<br>
<code><b>CachedRowSetImpl</b></code> - The <code>javax.sql.rowset.CachedRowSet</code> interface
reference implementation.<br>
<br>
<code><b>WebRowSetImpl</b></code> - The <code>javax.sql.rowset.WebRowSet</code> interface
reference implementation.<br>
<br>
<code><b>FilteredRowSetImpl</b></code> - The <code>javax.sql.rowset.FilteredRowSet</code>
interface reference implementation.<br>
<br>
<code><b>JoinRowSetImpl</b></code> - The <code>javax.sql.rowset.JoinRowSet</code> interface
reference implementation.<br>
</blockquote>

All details on their expected behavior, including their interactions with the <code>SyncProvider</code>
SPI and helper classes are provided in the interface definitions in the <code>javax.sql.rowset</code>
package specification.<br>

<h3>2.0 Usage</h3>
The reference implementations represent robust implementations of the standard
<code>RowSet</code> interfaces defined in the <code>javax.sql.rowset</code> package.
All disconnected <code>RowSet</code> implementations, such as the <code>CachedRowSetImpl</code>
and <code>WebRowSetImpl</code>, are flexible enough to use the <code>SyncFactory</code> SPIs to
leverage non-reference implementation <code>SyncProvider</code> implementations to obtain
differing synchronization semantics. Furthermore, developers and vendors alike are free
to use these implementations and integrate them into their products just as they
can with to other components of the Java platform.<br>

<h3>3.0 Extending the JDBC RowSet Implementations</h3>

The JDBC <code>RowSet</code> reference implementations are provided as non-final
classes so that any developer can extend them to provide additional features
while maintaining the core required standard functionality and compatibility. It
is anticipated that many vendors and developers will extend the standard feature
set to their their particular needs. The website for JDBC Technology will
provider a portal where implementations can be listed, similar to the way it
provides a site for JDBC drivers.
